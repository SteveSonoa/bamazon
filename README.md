# An Introduction to Bamazon
Welcome to Bamazon! This is a node CLI-only MySQL app that allows customer interactions on the front end, as well as manager & supervisor functions on the back end. Customers can view, sort, and buy items. Managers can view inventory, restock, and add new products. Supervisors can oversee departments and review P&L reports.

### What is the goal?

# Deployment
Node is required to run this app. After downloading the repository, run `npm install` from the command line to ensure you have the necessary packages. When that's complete, simply run `node hangman` from the main directory to begin. An Internet connection is required; the app will not run without it.
